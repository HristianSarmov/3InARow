The gameplay loop of the game is you vs. vs the computer. As the computer adds more fruit to the 10x10 field you try to swap them around, 
mix and match them so you can remove them before the computer floods the field and leads you to a loss.

### A Game Programming Uni Project

## Development 

I made this project, because of a Challenge Based Learning excercise about learning Java Swing and applying OOP and 
Swing basics learned in the course. Making the project required self learning about version control, game design
and user experience. As I had used Java and JavaFX before for another one of my projects, I had some experience in the field, 
and learning an old school component based framework like Swing wasn't too difficult. The out of the box availability that Swing 
has makes it a lot easier to use in small scale projects like this one, but the scene builder and XML file structure of Java FX 
would be a definite choice for any big project.
